### Summary of Learning – Week 1 Day 2
This assignment deepened my understanding of blockchain infrastructure.  
I explored how different chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche) vary in consensus, node roles, and scalability.  
I learned the difference between distributed ledgers and blockchains, and how NFTs redefine ownership through digital provenance.  
I also practiced using Markdown, tables, and GitHub submission workflows.
