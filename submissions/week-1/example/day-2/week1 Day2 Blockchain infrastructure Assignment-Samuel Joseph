NFTs vs Fungible Tokens
Key tech concepts
Fungible tokens are interchangeable units (ERC-20 on Ethereum is standard). They represent currency, utility, or governance. ERC-20 defines the standard API and is used by tokens like USDC, USDT, UNI, BNB (BEP-20 on BSC is Ethereum-compatible).
NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique on-chain identifiers (pair: contract address + tokenId) — common standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 — used to represent unique digital items, collectibles, or tokenized rights. Ownership is recorded on-chain and transferrable; smart contract code controls provenance, royalties (if implemented), and transfer rules. 
Ethereum Improvement Proposals


Ownership & practical effect

On-chain ownership gives provable, tamper-evident provenance and enables on-chain royalty enforcement (if contract supports it) and marketplace automation.

Ownership ≠ off-chain rights automatically: owning an NFT usually conveys a tokenized right (e.g., a claim, a license, or membership), but underlying copyright/physical property rights depend on the project’s legal terms. This gap is a frequent source of confusion and legal debate.

Real-world examples (5+), short analysis

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) — Ethereum

Collection of unique PFP NFTs (ERC-721) with strong secondary market on OpenSea; ownership records are on Ethereum and transfers are immutable and visible. Security incidents (phishing/social engineering) show custody risks remain off-chain. 
OpenSea


Axie Infinity (Axies) — Ronin (EVM sidechain)

Game NFTs (Axies) and in-game economy; Ronin was built to reduce fees & scale gaming transactions. Demonstrates how a specialized chain can enable massive in-game transactions and new economic models for players. 
AxieInfinity


NBA Top Shot — Flow (Dapper Labs)

“Moments” (collectible video highlights) as NFTs on Flow — shows an alternative chain (Flow) optimized for collectibles & UX (account model, scalability for consumer adoption). Ownership tracked on Flow; marketplace & developer tooling provided by Dapper.

Royal / Music NFTs

Royal allows fans to buy streaming royalties or shares of songs as NFTs — shows how NFTs can tokenize revenue rights and distribute royalties to fractional owners. Legal/royalty structures matter here.

Stablecoins / Fungible tokens (USDT, USDC)

USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) are fungible stablecoins used as on-chain money (ERC-20/BEP-20/etc.). They show fungible tokens’ role as medium-of-exchange and settlement in NFT markets and DeFi. Their governance and reserve transparency (attestations) affect trust/regulatory treatment.

Governance / Utility token example — UNI (Uniswap)

UNI is an ERC-20 governance token; holders vote on protocol upgrades and treasury usage — shows tokenized governance vs. tokenized unique assets. 
Uniswap Docs

Takeaway: NFTs add unique digital scarcity, provenance, and programmable sale/royalty mechanics — they change the practical meaning of "ownership" for digital goods by enabling verifiable, transferable on-chain claims, but legal rights and custody still require off-chain considerations.

🧵 Let’s unpack blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledgers, and how NFTs & tokens change ownership. Quick thread for #Web3 learners. #Blockchain #NFTs

🔹 Blockchains differ a lot. Bitcoin (PoW) secures value, Ethereum now uses PoS with split execution/consensus clients, Solana uses PoH+PoS for speed, Polkadot uses NPoS for cross-chain governance, Avalanche uses sub-sampled voting for fast finality. Sources: official docs.

🔸 Nodes & clients: running a node can be “full”, “light”, or a validator. Ethereum post-Merge needs execution + consensus clients (e.g., Geth + Lighthouse). Running nodes is how decentralization is enforced.

🔁 Distributed ledger ≠ blockchain. All blockchains are DLTs, but DLTs can be blockless and permissioned (e.g., Hyperledger, Corda) — important for enterprise use cases.

🖼️ NFTs vs tokens: NFTs (ERC-721/1155) are unique tokens that record provenance & ownership on-chain; fungible tokens (ERC-20) are interchangeable units used for money, utility, or governance. Standards matter.

🔍 Real examples: BAYC (Ethereum NFTs), Axie (Ronin/game chain), NBA Top Shot (Flow), Royal (music royalties), USDT/USDC (stablecoins), UNI (governance token). Each shows different ownership/economic models.

🧾 Ownership nuance: on-chain ownership = provable control of a token, but off-chain rights (copyright, venue access, physical item titles) depend on terms & law. Always check terms & custody. #NFTs #Law #Web3
