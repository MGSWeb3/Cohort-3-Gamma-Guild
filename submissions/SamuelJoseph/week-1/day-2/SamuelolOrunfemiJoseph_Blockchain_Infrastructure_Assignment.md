| Blockchain | Node types | Clients / software | Consensus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bitcoin | Full nodes, light nodes, miners | Bitcoin Core | Proof of Work (PoW). 20 |
| Ethereum | Execution clients + Consensus clients, full/light nodes | Geth, Nethermind; Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku | Proof of Stake (PoS) (post-Merge). 21 |
| Solana | Validators, RPC nodes, archival nodes | solana-validator (CLI) | Proof of History (PoH) + PoS (for validator selection). 22 |
| Polkadot | Validators, nominators, collators | polkadot (Substrate clients) | Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS). 23 |
| Avalanche | Validators, full nodes, RPC nodes | AvalancheGo | Avalanche consensus (sub-sampled voting, fast finality). 24 |


| Feature | Distributed Ledger (DLT) | Blockchain |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Replicated ledger across nodes; can be permissioned | Type of DLT that stores data in cryptographically chained blocks. 25 |
| Structure | Flexible (not necessarily block-based) | Block-chained structure |
| Consensus | Many types (permissioned algorithms common) | PoW/PoS/NPoS/others |
| Use cases | Enterprise, private networks (Hyperledger, Corda) | Public networks, open value transfer (Bitcoin/Ethereum) 26 |
