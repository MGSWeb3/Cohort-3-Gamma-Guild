Week 1 — Day 2: Blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledgers, NFTs & tokens

(Deliverable prepared for submission — copy/paste into your report)

1) Quick summary (TL;DR)

Blockchains are a class of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) that organize transactions into cryptographically-linked blocks; many blockchains are public and permissionless while some DLTs are permissioned and do not use token economics. 

I researched 5 networks (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Hyperledger Fabric/Flow), documenting node roles, clients, and consensus mechanisms. 

NFTs are unique tokens (non-fungible) used for digital ownership (art, collectibles, gaming); fungible tokens (ERC-20 / SPL / equivalent) represent interchangeable units (currencies, stablecoins, governance tokens). Real-world examples below.

2) Research: 5 blockchains — nodes, clients, consensus (concise profiles)

Bitcoin (public, permissionless)

Node roles: full nodes (validate blocks/transactions), SPV/light clients (wallets).

Clients/implementations: Bitcoin Core is the reference client; others exist but Bitcoin Core is dominant. 

Consensus mechanism: Proof of Work (PoW) — miners solve computational puzzles to propose blocks; network accepts longest valid chain (most cumulative PoW). 


Ethereum (public, now PoS after The Merge)

Node roles: Execution clients and Consensus/Beacon nodes (post-Merge separation); validators run consensus clients to propose/finalize blocks; light and archive nodes exist.

Clients/implementations: Execution: Geth, Besu, Nethermind; Consensus: Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus (examples). 

Consensus mechanism: Proof of Stake (PoS) with validator set and slashing for misbehavior (after The Merge). 


Solana (high-throughput public chain)

Node roles: Validators (process transactions / participate in consensus), RPC nodes (APIs for apps), light clients. 

Clients/implementations: Solana validator software (officially maintained); nodes run validator and RPC services. 

Consensus mechanism: Hybrid Proof-of-History (PoH) (a timestamping technique) combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for leader selection and confirmation — designed for high TPS. 


Polkadot (heterogeneous multi-chain)

Node roles: Relay-chain validators (secure and finalize the relay chain), collators (produce parachain blocks), nominators (stake to support validators). 

Clients/implementations: Parity’s Polkadot client (main), plus other nodes running Substrate-based runtimes. 

Consensus mechanism: Hybrid: BABE for block production (probabilistic) + GRANDPA for finality (fast provable finality); staking for security. 


Hyperledger Fabric (permissioned DLT for enterprises)

Node roles: peers (endorse and commit transactions), orderers (sequence/ordering service), certificate authorities (identity mgmt). Peers maintain ledgers and chaincode/smart contracts. 

Clients/implementations: Fabric SDKs (Go/Node/Java) and the Fabric peer/orderer binaries. Many deployments use enterprise distributions. 

Consensus mechanism: Pluggable — commonly crash-fault tolerant (CFT) or Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) orderers; no native token required (suits permissioned enterprise use).

3) Comparison: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) vs Blockchain (short, sharp)

Parent / child: DLT is the general concept of a distributed ledger; blockchains are a specific DLT design that orders transactions into blocks linked by cryptographic hashes. 

Structure: DLT may not use blocks or need global chaining; blockchain uses chained blocks. 

Permission model: DLTs can be permissioned (Hyperledger Fabric) for known participants; many blockchains are permissionless (Bitcoin, Ethereum). 

Token requirement: Blockchains powering crypto typically have tokens (for incentives, fees); permissioned DLTs may operate without native tokens. 

Use cases: DLTs (permissioned) → enterprise consortia, supply chain, regulated asset registries; blockchains → public money, open finance, public NFTs, token economies.

4) NFTs vs Fungible Tokens — Concepts then 7 real examples (analysis + real-world notes)

Concepts (brief)

NFTs (non-fungible tokens): Unique identifiers on a ledger representing ownership of a distinct asset (digital art, collectibles, game items). Standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 (Ethereum), equivalents on other chains (Flow, Tezos, Solana SPL-NFT patterns). 

Fungible tokens: Interchangeable units (like currency shares). Standards: ERC-20 on Ethereum, SPL tokens on Solana, BEP-20 on BSC, etc. Used for stablecoins, governance, utility tokens. 


Real-world examples (each with a short analysis)

1. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) — Ethereum (ERC-721)

High-profile PFP NFT collection; ownership confers community access & IP perks; shows how NFTs create social/branding value beyond the image. BAYC leveraged Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard and secondary market dynamics. 



2. NBA Top Shot — Flow (NFTs for moments)

Flow (by Dapper Labs) was built to scale collectibles (Top Shot). Top Shot sells licensed NBA "moments" as NFTs; demonstrates licensing + collectible economy on a chain optimized for consumer apps. 



3. CryptoKitties — Ethereum (early NFT app)

Early popular on-chain game that congested Ethereum in 2017; shows NFTs' ability to create viral demand and exposes scalability limits of a blockchain. 



4. Axie Infinity — NFTs + fungible in gaming economy

Combines NFTs (Axies) with fungible tokens (SLP, AXS). Demonstrates play-to-earn economic risks/rewards; the project’s boom and later issues (market collapse + large hack) highlight economic fragility and security risks in token economies. 



5. USDC (USD Coin) — fungible stablecoin (ERC-20 / multi-chain)

A widely used fungible stablecoin representing USD, used for payments, DeFi, and cross-chain settlement. It’s issued by Circle and runs on Ethereum and other chains (illustrates fungible token utility vs NFT uniqueness). 



6. RealT — tokenized real-estate (fractional ownership using fungible tokens)

RealT issues tokens representing fractional ownership or economic interest in real properties (on Ethereum). Example of tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Raises legal & compliance questions (how token = legal ownership). 



7. SPL Tokens on Solana (e.g., SOL & USDC on Solana)

Solana’s SPL token standard supports fungible tokens (e.g., wrapped USD-stablecoins, project tokens). Demonstrates how high-throughput chains host fungible economies and NFTs.

6) Risks, tradeoffs & practical notes (short)

Scalability vs decentralization: High-TPS chains (Solana, special layer-2s) trade some decentralization/design choices for throughput. Ethereum’s transition to PoS changed node client architecture and validator economics. 

Security & economic risks: Token economies (Axie, play-to-earn) can create fragile markets; smart contract hacks and bridges remain major attack vectors. 

Legal & compliance: Tokenizing real assets (RealT) requires careful legal structuring — tokens often represent contractual rights rather than automatic legal title
